<p>fmodchk - Generate alerts when file ages or file age differences
satisfy user supplied criteria.</p>
<p>

<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>fmodchk generates alerts when a violation is detected, i.e., the age
of a file (current time minus time of last modification) or the
difference in age between two files satisfies an expression (violation
criteria).  The expression is of one of these forms.</p>
<pre>
  FILE_AGE            OPERATOR AGE_OR_DURATION
  FILE_AGE_DIFFERENCE OPERATOR AGE_OR_DURATION</pre>
<p>where OPERATOR is a comparison operator (e.g., '&gt;') and
AGE_OR_DURATION is a threshold specified by the user.  Both the
operator and threshold value have defaults, for which, see the usage
statement (execute:  fmodchk --help).</p>
<p>To fmodchk, a file is anything with an inode, including directories.
Symbolic links are followed.</p>
<p>Examples of situations for which fmodchk might generate an alert:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The directory /foo/bar was modified more than an hour ago
<p></p>
<li>
The directory /foo/bar was modified less than an hour ago
<p></p>
<li>
The difference in ages between file A and file B is less than 1 day
<p></p>
<li>
File bat is older than file baz
<p></p>
<li>
File bat is younger than file baz by more than two weeks
<p></p>
<li>
The last file in a directory for response files is older than the last
file in a directory for stimulus files, and we're out of the response
window
<p></p></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="batch_options">BATCH OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p>Exactly one of the following options must be specified in batch mode
(stdin not associated with a tty):</p>
<p><strong>-r,--alerts-to Addr[,Addr[,...]]</strong></p>
<p>Send alert notification emails to the given comma-delimited email
address list.  Pathnames in the fmodchk-generated alert text will be
basenames only.</p>
<p><strong>-R,--trusted-alerts-to Addr[,Addr[,...]]</strong></p>
<p>Same as --alerts-to except that full pathnames are used in the
fmodchk-generated alert text.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="other_options">OTHER OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p><strong>-c,--config-file ConfigFile</strong></p>
<p>Get options from configuration file ConfigFile rather than from the
command line.  --config-file is incompatible with all options except
for --label.  Configfile must be a regular file and its size may not
exceed a default maximum value (for which, see usage statement:
fmodchk --help).</p>
<p>See the <a
href="#using_a_configuration_file"><strong>CONFIGURATION FILE</strong></a>
section for details on the configuration file.</p>
<p><strong>-d,--difference</strong></p>
<p>Indicate the difference in ages between two files' is being
examined.  (The default is to examine the age of each of a set of
files.)  Requires two file arguments.  The absolute value of the age
difference will be compared to a value given by the --threshold
option or to a default if --threshold is not used.</p>
<p><strong>-D,--signed-difference</strong></p>
<p>Same as --difference except that a signed difference will be
compared.  The order of the files on the command line is
significant.  The difference will be calculated as the first file's
age minus the second file's age.  <code>age(A)</code> - <code>age(B)</code> &gt; 0 will indicate
that A is older than B, where A is given before B on the command
line.  <code>age(A)</code> - <code>age(B)</code> &lt; 0 will indicate that A is younger than B.</p>
<p><strong>-e,--errors-to Addr[,Addr[,...]]</strong></p>
<p>Send runtime warnings/errors encountered by this program (not
alerts), to the given comma-delimited email address list.  The
default list to which errors are sent is in the usage statement
(fmodchk --help).  This option is ignored when not in batch mode.</p>
<p><strong>-f,--mail-from Addr</strong></p>
<p>Use Addr as the value of the "From: " header in the alert email
messages.  The default address to which errors are sent is in the
usage statement (fmodchk --help).  This option is ignored when not
in batch mode.</p>
<p><strong>-h,--help</strong></p>
<p>List usage.</p>
<p><strong>-l,--label LabelList</strong></p>
<p>Process only configuration file blocks named by comma-delimited
LabelList.  The default is to process all configuration blocks that
don't specify 'label-invocation-only'.</p>
<p>This option may be used multiple times.  Requires use of
--config-file option.  Incompatible with all other options.</p>
<p>To specify a label that actually contains a comma, escape the comma
using a backslash, e.g., '\,'.</p>
<p><strong>-P,--alert-patrol</strong></p>
<p>Indicate that the local bmc patrol is to be informed of alerts.</p>
<p><strong>-t,--threshold [ComparisonOperator]DurationSpec</strong></p>
<p>Specify DurationSpec and optionally ComparisonOperator for file age
or age difference comparison.  See the usage statement (fmodchk
--help) for a list of valid comparison operators.  See usage statement
also for default values for DurationSpec and ComparisonOperators.</p>
<p>Note that the condition specified in this option is the condition for
which an alert will be sent.  It is not the steady-state,
non-violation condition.</p>
<p>This option is ignored if --response-window is used.</p>
<p><strong>-T,--alert-comments Text</strong></p>
<p>Append Text to the alert message.  Any backslash-n sequences ('\n')
will be converted to newlines.</p>
<p>It is strongly suggested that alert comments be used for all alerts. 
Example configuration file snippet:</p>
<pre>
      alert-comments     &lt;&lt; EndComments
          ***
          The lack of a young enough archive file for this inbound Foo
          archive directory may mean that we didn't receive a file on time
          from Foo &amp; Associates.  Please investigate.
          ***
          EndComments</pre>
<p>By default, the alert text contains only age or age difference data. 
The alert comments are used to give context.</p>
<p>NOTE:  Do not include information (such as full pathnames) in alert
comments that you would not want sent in regular (untrusted) alert
messages.</p>
<p><strong>-w,--response-window DurationSpec</strong></p>
<p>Indicate the duration of the response window whose start time is the
time of last modification of a stimulus file.  Requires
--signed-difference.  Implies the threshold '&gt;0'.  Duration spec must
evaluate to a value greater than 0 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="specifying_durations">SPECIFYING DURATIONS</a></h1>
<p>A duration specification is an indication of an amount of time, from a
few seconds to a number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  Duration
specifications are given using one of the following three forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
&lt;DAYS&gt;+HH:MM:SS
<p>One or more days digits, a literal '+', and two each of hours,
minutes, and seconds digits, separated by colons.  Example: 
100+12:30:00</p>
<p></p>
<li>
&lt;HOURS&gt;:MM:SS
<p>One or more hours digits and two each of minutes and seconds digits
separated by colons.  Example:  2:00:00</p>
<p></p>
<li>
&lt;SECONDS&gt;
<p>One or more seconds digits.  Example:  7200</p>
<p></p></ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="specifying_files">SPECIFYING FILES</a></h1>
<p>A 'file' is considered by fmodchk to be anything that has an inode. 
Files may be specified as pathnames or globs.  Each glob is expanded
into a set of matching pathnames.  In addition, the following form
may be used to specify a file:</p>
<pre>
  AGE_SELECTOR(GLOB)</pre>
<p>GLOB is a file glob, and must be enclosed in parentheses as shown.
AGE_SELECTOR may be one of the following, using any combination of
uppercase and/or lowercase letters:</p>
<pre>
  { 'o', 'oldest', 'y', 'youngest' }</pre>
<p>Each instance of the use of the age selectors 'oldest' and 'youngest'
will cause a single pathname to be specified, which will be generated
by expanding the glob and then choosing the oldest or youngest file,
respectively.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="logging">LOGGING</a></h1>
<p>fmodchk uses Log::Transcript, so all logging is done to stderr.
Additionally a session transcript may be emailed under certain
conditions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="using_a_configuration_file">USING A CONFIGURATION FILE</a></h1>
<p>An fmodchk configuration file is a text file whose maximum size is
given in the usage message (fmodchk --help).</p>
<p>If an fmodchk command line contains the --config-file option, fmodchk
will get all of its configuration information, including a list of
checks to be performed, from the active configuration blocks in the
named file.  If --config-file is not used, then the check specified
on the command line will be performed.</p>
<p>If both --config-file and --label are used, then only the active
configuration blocks whose block names are identified by the given
label list are used.  ("Label" is synonymous with "configuration
block name".)  If --config-file is used without --label, all active
configuration blocks in the configuration file are processed.</p>
<p>A configuration file is logically a set of tasks to be performed by
fmodchk.  These tasks contain the checks to be performed and other
attributes of the task, e.g., to whom to email alerts.</p>
<p>The configuration file is a text file in which apache-like blocks of
configuration text are present.  A block has the form:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;blockname&gt;
    .
    .
    .
  &lt;/blockname&gt;</pre>
<p>Blocks can be nested.</p>
<p>Key-value statements occur in blocks.  A key value statement has the
form:</p>
<pre>
  key&lt;whitespace&gt;value</pre>
<p>The value may contain whitespace.  Everything after the whitespace that
follows the key is considered to be the value for that key.</p>
<p>Blocknames and keywords may be specified in either upper- or
lowercase.  They will be lowercased when parsed.  The case of values,
however, will not be modified.  For example, the following configuration
snippet:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;fOO&gt;
    Bar   This Is the Value For Bat
    BAZ   MUMBLE mumble
  &lt;/Foo</pre>
<p>will be stored in memory as the following perl data structure:</p>
<pre>
  foo =&gt; {
    bar =&gt; 'This Is the Value For Bat',
    baz =&gt; 'MUMBLE mumble',
  }</pre>
<p>fmodchk requires that all configuration data in the file be enclosed in
a top level block called "fmodchk":</p>
<pre>
  &lt;fmodchk&gt;
    .
    .
    .
  &lt;/fmodchk&gt;</pre>
<p>Within this block may be zero or more "task" blocks, i.e., blocks that
represent tasks, or checks that are to be performed.  The exception to
this is the master suspend block.</p>
<p>A task block consists of key-value statements and blocks from which
argument vectors ("argv's"), or, arrays of options, are built.  The
long form of the options described in the usage statement (minus the
"--" prefixes) are used as key values in a task block.  In addition
to these options, the keys "file" and "label-invocation-only" may be
used in task blocks.</p>
<p>The "file" key is used to specify a file, glob, or age selector.  See
section <a href="#specifying_files"><strong>SPECIFYING
FILES</strong></a> for more information about the values for
the "file" keyword.</p>
<p>The "file" keyword may appear multiple times to specify multiple files:</p>
<pre>
  file    /usr/local/foo
  file    /usr/local/bar
  file    /usr/local/bat
  file    /usr/local/baz</pre>
<p>So, what would be given on the command line as:</p>
<pre>
  $ fmodchk --alerts-to foo@bar.domain --threshold '&gt; 1+00:00:00' \
            --alert-patrol --alert-text &quot;check job FOO&quot; '/tmp/junk*'</pre>
<p>Would be specified as the following task block:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;my_block&gt;
    alerts-to      foo@bar.domain
    threshold      &gt; 1+00:00:00
    alert-patrol   yes
    alert-text     check job FOO
    file           /tmp/junk*
  &lt;/my_block&gt;</pre>
<p>The 'label-invocation-only' key is a boolean key used in a task block
to indicate that the block may be considered for processing (if it is
active) only if specified on the command line in the LabelList option
argument to the --label option.  If the --label option is not used,
the block will not be processed.  If the --label option is used, but
the block's name is not in the given label list, the block will not
be processed.  Configuration blocks without this boolean key (or with a
false value for it) represent tasks which can be performed at any time.
That is, they are not time sensitive tasks.  Tasks which are
label-invocation-only tasks are time sensitive, and this boolean key is
used to make sure they are only processed when explicitly called.</p>
<p>Note that values for boolean options (e.g., "difference", or
"signed-difference") may the following boolean values:</p>
<pre>
  true   false
  1      0
  yes    no
  on     off</pre>
<p>NOTE:  If a boolean key is given without a value, e.g.:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;my_block&gt;
    .
    .
    .
    alert-patrol
    .
    .
    .
  &lt;my_block&gt;</pre>
<p>a true value will be assigned to it.  Using the example block above,
Patrol would be alerted.</p>
<p><strong>Suspend blocks</strong></p>
<p>fmodchk processes only active configuration blocks.  A block is
active (vs. suspended) if one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It does not contain a suspend block
<p></p>
<li>
It contains a suspend block, but the current time is not in the
interval indicated in the suspend block
<p></p></ul>
<p>Suspend blocks are used to toggle the active / inactive status of
either the entire configuration file or of selected blocks.  When a
suspend block contains an active suspend interval, its enclosing
block is inactive (suspended), i.e., not considered for processing.</p>
<p>A suspend block may occur in the top level "fmodchk" block (the
master suspend block), or in any task block.  It has the form:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;suspend&gt;
    from  TIMESPEC
    to    TIMESPEC
  &lt;/suspend&gt;</pre>
<p>where TIMESPEC is a string which represents a date and time.  fmodchk
parses a TIMESPEC by first removing all non-digit characters and then
calling Date::Manip::ParseDate.  The following are valid fmodchk
TIMESPEC formats:</p>
<pre>
            YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
            YYYYMMDDHHMM
            YYYYMMDDHH
            YYYYMMDD
            YYYYMM
            YYYY</pre>
<p>Any TIMESPEC that collapses into one of these forms when all
non-digit characters are removed, may be used.</p>
<p>At least one of the keys "to" and "from" must be specified.  If both
are specified, the date and time represented by "to" must be later
than the date and time represented by "from".</p>
<p>A suspend block defines a time interval in the local time zone.  If
the current time falls in that interval, the interval is said to be
active.  And when a suspend interval is active, its enclosing block is
inactive (suspended) and is not considered for processing.</p>
<p>When both keys are given, the interval starts at the "from" time and
ends at the "to" time.  When only "from" is given, the interval
starts at the "from" time and has no end.  When only "to" is given,
the interval ends at the "to" time but has no beginning.  For example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;suspend&gt;
    from  20050701
    to    2006 01 01
  &lt;/suspend&gt;</pre>
<p>specifies a time interval beginning July 1, 2005 at 0:00 local time
and ends January 1, 2006 at 0:00.</p>
<pre>
  &lt;suspend&gt;
    from  2004-03-05 18:45:00
  &lt;/suspend&gt;</pre>
<p>specifies an interval beginning March 5, 2004 at 6:45 pm local time
but having no end.</p>
<pre>
  &lt;suspend&gt;
    to    2004/03/05 18.45.00
  &lt;/suspend&gt;</pre>
<p>specifies an interval ending March 5, 2004 at 6:45 pm local time but
having no beginning.</p>
<p>A suspend block, like any text in the configuration can be commented
out, or have individual fields commented out.</p>
<p><strong>Comments and ignored fields</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this documentation, language such as "the configuration
file contains [something]" is usually used to mean that it contains
[something] and the <code>line(s)</code> that contain [something] are not
commented out.</p>
<p>Config::General, which parses the configuration file, recognizes
comments as existing from a pound sign (#) to the end of the line. 
It also recognizes C-style comments ( /* */ ).  If a pound sign is
required in a value, it can be escaped with a backslash.  Pound signs
don't need to be escaped in here documents.</p>
<p>Anything commented out as mentioned above will not become part of any
data structure resulting from parsing the configuration file.  That is,
fmodchk will not be aware of its existence.</p>
<p>There are two names that will become part of parsed configuration
data structures, but will be ignored by fmodchk.  fmodchk will ignore
any key-value statement whose key is "comment" or "comments" and will
ignore any "comment" or "comments" blocks.  These key-value
statements and blocks will become a part of the configuration data
(unlike the comments in the file using # and /* */, which are ignored
by the parser).  The value in this is that information can be
included in the configuration blocks themselves which will be logged
when the block is logged.</p>
<p><strong>Line continuation</strong></p>
<p>Lines may be continued by quoting the newline with a backslash.  Using:</p>
<pre>
  mykey foo \
          bar \
          bat \
          baz \
          mumble</pre>
<p>the value for mykey will become "foo bar bat baz mumble".</p>
<p><strong>Here documents</strong></p>
<p>Using:</p>
<pre>
  mykey &lt;&lt;EOD
      line 1
      line 2</pre>
<pre>
      line 4
    EOD</pre>
<p>the value for mykey will become:</p>
<pre>
  line 1
  line 2</pre>
<pre>
  line 4</pre>
<p>An amount of whitespace equal to that occuring before the delimiter
("EOD") will be removed from each line in the here doc.</p>

<h1><a name="invocation_examples">INVOCATION EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p>There are five kinds of tests identified currently which can be
implemented using fmodchk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Age check
<p></p>
<li>
Recent modification check
<p></p>
<li>
Unsigned difference check
<p></p>
<li>
Signed difference check
<p></p>
<li>
Stimulus-response check
<p></p></ul>
<p><strong>Age check</strong></p>
<p>In this example, we want to send a trusted alert (full pathname
information included) to foo@bar.domain if directory /usr/local is less
than sixty days old.  We want the email to appear to come from
&lt;bat@baz.domain&gt;, rather than the default address (for which see usage
statement: fmodchk --help).  We want BMC Patrol to be made aware
of any alerts.  We'd like the recipients of the alert to contact the
help desk at (555)-555-5555.  Rather than having runtime error
transcripts emailed to the default email <code>address(es)</code> (for which, see
usage statement), we want error transcripts to be sent to
&lt;thomas.tallis@motets.domain&gt;.</p>
<p>We could use the following invocation in a crontab entry (must be all
on one line in the crontab; broken across multiple lines here only
for readability):</p>
<pre>
  /FULL/PATH/TO/fmodchk                                           \
    --trusted-alerts-to foo@bar.domain                            \
    --errors-to thomas.tallis@motets.domain                       \
    --mail-from bat@baz.domain                                    \
    --alert-patrol                                                \
    --alert-comments 'Please contact help desk at (555) 555-5555' \
    --threshold '&lt; 60+00:00:00'                                   \
    /usr/local</pre>
<p>Alternatively, we could specify a configuration file in the invocation:</p>
<pre>
  /FULL/PATH/TO/fmodchk --config-file /PATH/TO/fmodchk.conf</pre>
<p>and include the following block in fmodchk.conf:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;usr-local-age-check&gt;
    trusted-alerts-to  foo@bar.domain
    errors-to          thomas.tallis@motets.domain
    mail-from          bat@baz.domain
    alert-patrol       yes
    alert-comments     Please contact help desk at (555) 555-5555
    threshold          &lt; 60+00:00:00
    file               /usr/local
  &lt;/usr-local-age-check&gt;</pre>
<p>The name you use for the block can be any identifier.  It is recommended
that you use something descriptive and unique to the task.</p>
<p><strong>Recent modification check</strong></p>
<p>In this example, we want to send an untrusted alert to mumble@bar.domain if
the youngest file in directory /data/flows/foo_associates/inbound/archive
is over two hours old.  In this case, we want fmodchk to execute only
a single time sensitive task, and only at a certain time.  Therefore,
in the invocation, we direct fmodchk to use only one block in a
configuration file:</p>
<pre>
  /FULL/PATH/TO/fmodchk                                        \
    --config-file /some/directory/fmodchk.configuration        \
    --label foo-associates-inbound-archive-recent-modification</pre>
<p>In /some/directory/fmodchk.configuration, we then have:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;foo-associates-inbound-archive-recent-modification&gt;
    label-invocation-only
    alerts-to              mumble@bar.domain
    threshold              &gt; 2:00:00
    alert-comments &lt;&lt;EndOfAlertComments
       We haven't archived an inbound file from Foo &amp; Associates
       for over two hours.  Please investigate.
       EndOfAlertComments
    file    youngest(/data/flows/foo_associates/inbound/archive/*)
  &lt;/foo-associates-inbound-archive-recent-modification&gt;</pre>
<p>Note that because of the inclusion of the label-invocation-only key in
the block, this block will ever be executed only if its name is in a
label list given with the --label option.</p>
<p>Note that label-invocation-only was not given a value.  When this
happens for a boolean key, the value is taken to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Unsigned difference check</strong></p>
<p>Send a trusted alert to william.byrd@composers.domain if the absolute
value of the age difference between directory / and directory /etc is
less than or equal to three and a half days.  Cron entry:</p>
<pre>
  /FULL/PATH/TO/fmodchk                               \
    --trusted-alerts-to william.byrd@composers.domain \
    --difference                                      \
    --threshold '&lt;= 3+12:00:00'                       \
    '{/,/etc}'</pre>
<p>Note that on this particular invocation, we arbitrarily chose to use a
file glob (using curly brace expansion) to specify the directories.  We
could just as easily have listed the directories individually:</p>
<pre>
  / /etc</pre>
<p>Alternatively, here is a configuration block that defines the same task:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;root-etc-unsigned-difference&gt;
    trusted-alerts-to william.byrd@composers.domain
    difference
    threshold         &lt;= 3+12:00:00
    file              {/,/etc}
  &lt;root-etc-unsigned-difference&gt;</pre>
<p><strong>Signed difference check</strong></p>
<p>Send a trusted alert to unreliable.pager@archpageless.domain if
/etc/foo.config is older than /etc/bar.config by more then ten seconds.</p>
<pre>
  /FULL/PATH/TO/fmodchk                                      \
    --trusted-alerts-to unreliable.pager@archpageless.domain \
    --signed-difference                                      \
    --threshold '&gt; 10'                                       \
    '/etc/{foo,bar}.config'</pre>
<p>Again, we arbitrarily chose to use brace expansion rather than list
both files separately.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here is a configuration block that defines the same task:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;etc-foo-bar-config-signed-difference&gt;
    trusted-alerts-to  unreliable.pager@archpageless.domain
    signed-difference
    threshold          &gt; 10
    file               /etc/{foo,bar}.config
  &lt;/etc-foo-bar-config-signed-difference&gt;</pre>
<p><strong>Stimulus-response check</strong></p>
<p>Assume that whenever we send Squidly Sushi &amp; Bait a *.bait file, we
expect a *.switch file in response within eighteen hours.  Assume we
have separate inbound and outbound archive directories for Squidly
files.  Then we will detect that Squidly has not sent a response that
meets our time requirements when both of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The current time is more than eighteen hours after the latest
(youngest) file in the outbound archive was last modified
<p></p>
<li>
The youngest inbound (response) file is older (its age is greater) than the
youngest outbound (stimulus) file
<p></p></ul>
<p>Here is a cron invocation that would accomplish this:</p>
<pre>
  /FULL/PATH/TO/fmodchk                                         \
    --trusted-alerts-to squidly-monitors@bait.and.switch.domain \
    --signed-difference                                         \
    --response-window 18:00:00                                  \
    youngest(/data/flows/squidly/outbound/archive/*.bait)       \
    youngest(/data/flows/squidly/inbound/archive/*.switch)</pre>
<p>Note that --threshold is not used (and it is ignored if given).  The
threshold used when --response-window is given is '&lt;0'.  When doing a
stimulus-response check, list the stimulus file first and the response
file second.  That is, detect a violation if the signed difference:</p>
<pre>
  age( stimulus file ) - age( response file ) &lt; 0</pre>
<p>Alternatively, here is a configuration block that defines the same task:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;squidly-bait-switch-stimulus-response&gt;
    trusted-alerts-to  squidly-monitors@bait.and.switch.domain
    signed-difference
    response-window    18:00:00
    file  youngest(/data/flows/squidly/outbound/archive/*.bait)
    file  youngest(/data/flows/squidly/inbound/archive/*.switch)
  &lt;/squidly-bait-switch-stimulus-response&gt;</pre>
