    t2 - t1  +  t4 - t3  +  t6 - t5  +  ...  +  tN - tN-1</pre>
    Each odd numbered time is the start of a duration.  Each even
    numbered time is a temporary stop time of the duration, followed
    by another start time.  The last time, is of course the final end
    time of the duration.  Given all of the start times and stop
    times, duration prints to stdout the amount of time of the
    complete duration.

usage: xfe [ options ]
       xfe Invocation

options:

  -a,--attrfile [ Attrfile ]    Use randomly selected attributes from an
                                attributes file, Attrfile if given, to
                                determine colors.  The default attribute file
                                is TBD.  The default method of determining
                                colors is to generate random hex numbers as
                                color values.

  -A,--hex                      Use randomly generated six-digit hex numbers
                                as values for colors.  If a contrast threshold
                                value is specified (elsewhere), use the first
                                set of generated hex color values that
                                satisfies the contrast threshold value.
                                Otherwise use the first set of hex color values
                                generated.  This is the default method for
                                determining colors.

  -b,--bg,--background Color    Use Color as background color.  The default
                                method of determining colors is to generate
                                random hex numbers as color values.

  -c,--cr,--cursor Color        Use Color as cursor color.  The default is to
                                use the foreground color.

  -C,--contrast ContrastThreshold
                                Use ContrastThreshold as the minimum contrast
                                threshold value between foreground and
                                background colors.  The default minimum
                                contrast threshold value is 0.  The use of this
                                option never causes an error.  If it is not
                                appropriate on the given command line, it is
                                ignored.  ContrastThreshold must be a
                                non-negative integer or real number.

  -d,--debug [ DebugSpec ]      Turn on debug mode.  If DebugSpec is used,
                                the characters contained in this string will
                                govern which debug modes are selected.  If
                                DebugSpec is not used, the default mode of
                                debug information is shown.  The following
                                characters in DebugSpec result in the
                                following debug information being shown.

                                  0 => show command lines as they are expanded,
                                       colors selected.
                                       This is the default debug mode.

                                DebugSpec may not contain whitespace.

  -e,--execute Command [ ... ]  Execute Command with optional arguments.  This
                                option must be last on the command line.  The
                                default command is /bin/bash.

  -f,--foreground,--fg Color    Use Color as the cursor color.  The default 
                                method of determining colors is to generate
                                random hex numbers as color values.

  -F,--fn,--font Font           Use Font as the font.  The default font is
                                TBD.

  -g,--gm,--geometry Geometry   Use Geometry as the geometry.  The default
                                geometry is 80x40.

  -h,-?,--help                  List usage and exit with status indicating
                                success.

  -H,--host HostSpec            Connect to another host.  HostSpec determines
                                how this is done.  HostSpec must be of one of
                                the following forms:  cmd@user@host
                                                      cmd@@host
                                                      user@host
                                                      host
                                The default command is ssh.  The default user
                                is the user invoking xfe.

  -i,--inline InlineSpec        Expand InlineSpec into the command line where
                                it appears.  All such expansions are
                                preprocessed before command line processing.
                                InlineSpec may specify the location of any
                                legal xfe command line or portion thereof,
                                except that nested --inline invocations are
                                not currently supported.  

                                If InlineSpec is the name of a defined
                                environment variable then the value of the
                                variable will be inlined.  Else if InlineSpec
                                is the name of an existing file, the first
                                line in the file is inlined.

  -I,--icontitle Title          Use Title as the icon title.  The default icon
                                title is the window title.

  -m,--meta                     Randomly select a method to determine colors.
                                That is, let xfe randomly decide which
                                of the method options to use to determine the
                                colors.  The default method of determining
                                colors is to generate random hex numbers as
                                color values.

  -n,--no-window                Do not launch an xterm window.  This is useful
                                for debugging/informational purposes.

  -p,--plain,--failsafe         Cause xfe to use the xterm defaults for
                                (i.e., cause xfe not to specify):
                                     color selection
                                     scroll bar
                                     geometry
                                     font
                                     (TBD: others?)
                                Title selection (and TBD: others) will still
                                be done by xfe.  The default is for xfe to
                                make all of the selections mentioned above.

  -r,--rgbdb                    Use randomly selected colors from the rgb
                                database as values for colors.  If a contrast
                                threshold value is specified (elsewhere), use
                                the first set of selected values that satisfies
                                the contrast threshold value.  Otherwise use
                                the first set of values selected.  The default
                                method of determining colors is to generate
                                random hex numbers as color values.

  -s,--su [ - ] [ User ]        Switch user to User.  If the optional dash is
                                supplied, it is passed on to su(1) as an
                                argument.  The target user is User if given,
                                root otherwise.  If the environment variable
                                XFESUCMD is set, its value is passed to
                                su(1)'s -c option.

  -S,--summary                  List usage summary and exit successfully.

  -t,--title Title              Set window title to Title.  Environment
                                variable interpolation is performed and
                                the following backslash escape sequences
                                are supported:

                          method = "attrfile")
            \e            The basename of the window command followed by its
                          arguments
            \E            The window command followed by its arguments
            \f            The foreground color
            \h            The system hostname, up to the first '.'
            \H            The system hostname
            \u            The username of the current user
            \w            The current working directory
            \W            The basename of the current working directory


  -v,--verbose [ Increment ]    Select verbose output level.  Each instance of
                                this option increases the verbose level from
                                an initial level of 0 (no verbose output, the
                                default).  If Increment is used, the level is
                                increased by that amount.  Otherwise it is
                                increased by 1.  Increment must be a positive
                                integer.  Examples:  "-v 4" and "-vv -v 2"
                                would both result in a verbose level of 4.

  -V,--version                  Print version information and exit with status
                                indicating success.

  -x,--xterm-args arg [ arg ... ] ;,--end
                                Pass arguments verbatim to xterm(1).  The -x
                                form of this option is bounded by a
                                semi-colon.  The --xterm-args form is bounded
                                by --end.  If this option is last on the
                                command line, it is not necessary for the args
                                to be bounded.  xfe does not check the option
                                arguments to this option.  The user should be
                                familiar with xterm(1) options and should
                                exercise care in choosing them.  Note that if
                                -e is used as an option argument to this
                                option, then xfe's -e (--execute) option
                                should not also be used.

Options in the set:

  { --attrfile, --background, --cursor, --foreground, --hex, --rgbdb, --meta }

are color selection options because they determine the method of selecting
colors.  They are incompatible with each other except for:

  { --background, --cursor, --foreground }

which may be used together.

The following options are "command" options and may be used only one per
command line:  { --execute, --host, --su }.

The --plain option may not be used with any of the color selection options, or
any of these options: { --font, --geometry }.
