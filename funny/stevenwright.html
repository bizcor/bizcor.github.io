sign below it that said "self service". So I hired myself. Then I made
myself the boss. I gave myself a raise. I paid myself. Then I quit.

my analyst today and he says I have a problem." So I asked, "What's the
problem?" She replied, "I can't tell you. I don't even know you..." I
said, "Well sometimes it's good to tell your problems to a perfect
stranger on a bus." So she said, "Well, my analyst said I'm a
nymphomaniac and I only like Jewish cowboys... by the way, my name is
Denise." I said, "Hello, Denise. My name is Bucky Goldstein..."

was there, and she said "I thought I told you to go to sleep."
