<h2>Emo Phillips quotes</h2>

<p>
I went to school, ya know. I went to grammar school and once we were
taking a test and I was copying this other kid's paper, and I guess the
teacher heard my xerox machine. She said, "Emo, am I stupid or were you
cheating?," and I said, "Ah, yes and no." She sends me to the principal's
office and I get there and sit down and he looks at me and says, "Emo,
Emo, Emo." I said, "I'm the one in the middle, you drunken slob." He said,
"Emo, how would you like to repeat the fifth grade?" I said, "I don't
know if I could do it exactly, but I could try." He said, "I could expel
you!" I said, "You'll have to catch and eat me first, ya wierdo." He said,
"Emo, you'll have to see the school psychologist." And I said, "But why do
I have to see the school psychologist?" So he shows me the petition. So
I went to the psychologist and he says, "Emo, what does this inkblot
look like to you?" I said, "Well, it's kind of embarrassing." He said,
"Emo, everyone sees something silly. Don't be embarrassed. Tell me,
what does this inkblot look like to you?" I said, "Well, uh, to me, um,
it looks like, uh, standard pattern number 3 in the Rorshach series to
test obssessive compulsiveness." And he got kind of depressed, so I said,
"OK, it's a butterfly." And he cheered up. "And what does this inkblot
look like?" I said it looks like a horrible, ugly blob of pure evil,
that sucks the souls of men into a vortex of sin and degredation." He
said, "No, uh the inkblots over there, that's a photo of my wife
you're looking at." "Oh, was I far off?" He said, "No, that's the sad
part." And he gave me a chocolate easter bunny and I ate the bunny,
then I thought, hey, this isn't easter. "Is this a test?" And he said,
"Yes." "And what does it mean?" He said, "Had you eaten the ears first
you would have been normal. Had you eaten the feet first you would have
had an inferiority complex. Had you eaten the tail first you would have
had latent homosexual tendencies and had you eaten the breasts first
you would have had a latent oedipal complex." "Well...go on, what does
it mean when you bite out the eyes and scream 'stop staring at me?'" He
said, "It means you have a tendency towards self destruction." I said,
"Well, what do you recommend?" He said, "Go for it."


<p>
I was walking across a bridge one day, and i saw a man standing on the
edge, about to jump off. so i ran over and said "stop! don't do it!"
"Why shouldn't I?" he said. I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!"
He said, "Like what?" I said, "Well...are you religious or atheist?" He
said, "Religious." I said, "Me too! Are you christian or buddhist?" He
said, "Christian." I said, "Me too! Are you catholic or protestant?" He
said, "Protestant." I said, "Me too! Are you episcopalian or baptist?"
He said, "Baptist!" I said, "Wow! Me too! Are you baptist church of god
or baptist church of the lord?" He said, "Baptist church of god!" I
said, "Me too! Are you original baptist church of god, or are you
reformed baptist church of god?" He said, "Reformed baptist church of
god!" I said, "Me too! Are you reformed baptist church of god,
reformation of 1879, or reformed baptist church of god, reformation of
1915?" He said, "Reformed baptist church of god, reformation of 1915!" I
said, "Die, heretic scum", and pushed him off.

I got in a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said, "I'm
going to mop the floor with your face." I said, "You'll be sorry." He
said, "Oh, yeah? Why?" I said, "Well, you won't be able to get into the
corners very well."
