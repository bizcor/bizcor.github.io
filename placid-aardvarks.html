i imposed a solution on you for a problem that maybe didn't even exist.  i ghosted you temporarily.

<p>
what i did:
<br>* unilaterally decided to help, and then unilaterally determined <i>how</i> to help you with your screen time, at least today with me and messaging.  metaphorically temporarily ghosted you.

<p>
what i don't like about it:
<br>* i didn't ask you if you wanted help
<br>* if i had, and you wanted help, i didn't ask you what might be the most helpful
<br>* feels crappy to me, and maybe obnoxious

<p>
what i'd like to have done instead
<br>* said to you that given what i know about your screen time concerns, i might be taking too much of your time away from what you might want to do, and so may not be helping
<br>* asked you if i could help by going away for a while
<br>* accepting your response and acting on it

<p>
what i'll do in the future
<br>* not this!

<p>
it may sound like i'm beating myself up, but i'm not.  this is an external representation of how i work it out when i notice i've done something i'd like to do differently.

I gave you an unsatisfactory answer last night about Marilyn and Sybille.  I'd like another go at it...

<p>
Marilyn ran a soup kitchen in a church not too far from Advent.  When that kitchen was temporarily unavailable, she used the kitchen at Advent.  So I'd seen her around Advent.  Soon after that some Opera Plaza residents and I threw a party.  Marilyn was there and enjoyed speaking with her.  A couple months later as I was walking home from work downtown, I passed her on her way to the Tonga Room, a tiki bar (complete with live rain!).  She said she was meeting friends and would I like to join them.  I had drinks with her and her son Chris (the one who passed away two years ago), Sybille (who was currently boarding with Marilyn, and whose English I thought was already quite advanced), and two of Marilyn's former "students", visiting from Switzerland.  Marilyn had an arrangement with an English as a second language school in downtown SF.  They paid her to board students for months at a time.  After drinks we all went to a restaurant in North Beach.  I hadn't really noticed Sybille at the Tonga Room, but at the restaurant we were seated next to each other and had a blast.  Sybille and I talked a little about exercise and soon Marilyn, Sybille and I were meeting after work each week and walking in different San Francisco locales.

<p>
[...stuff happens, time passes...]

<p>
In December 2015 Sybille broke up with Simi (her other boyfriend--who lived in her town in Switzerland).  Needless to say, I was happy she got rid of the other guy.  I'd considered moving to Switzerland, but wanted to experience being in an exclusive relationship for at least a year before taking such a step (my therapist's very good suggestion).  Then in January 2016 she broke up with me.

<p>
Marilyn rooted for me throughout the entire bi-continental relationship.  She would say humorously "I hope Sybille doesn't fuck this up!"  She totally supported me.  She was tolerant with me because I wanted most of the time to talk about Sybille!

<p>
I no longer think Birdj is an asshole.  I've reframed a lot of my thinking about such things.  Ha ha I don't know how Marilyn currently thinks of him.  I'm sure she's still angry at some level.  He'd treated her quite badly when they were married.

<p>[Please don't share this.  Thank you.]
