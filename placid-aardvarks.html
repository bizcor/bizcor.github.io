<p>TL;DR -- I'm soooooo happy I'm reading the attachment book.  It's already helpful in understanding why I sometimes have reactions that are harmful to me.  It's ironic that in trying to protect myself, the source of those reactions can hurt me unless I consciously intervene.  It helps me not to feel shame about a type of reaction that's difficult to control.  The good news is that I have agency in responding. That's what I'm all about now--learning how successfully to intervene.  (In case you're interested, I'm putting my notes on the attachment book <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbgASvMwCNr9ZmBRvpzWskq8L2aX8IGrAy6k40eyuJA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.)

<p>My greatest revelation so far reading that book is reflected in this quote from the book.  The author is referring to herself.

<blockquote>
<i>
My brain wasn't making a conscious choice to feel or act this way; it was simply responding to signals that my nervous system perceived as a threat. Even more challenging, these responses happen at lightning speed while the rest of our brain operates at a much slower pace--and once the alarm in our body senses this painful disconnection, our conscious thoughts can't stop it.  However, it is possible to rewire our ability to regulate--the missing link in our developmental process as infants who did not receive consistent caregiving. Thanks to something called neuroplasticity, our brains can develop new circuitry at any age. The process of becoming self-full involves having the experiences of care and soothing we needed as children now.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm really looking forward to learning about the role my autonomous nervous system (ANS) plays in this.  Entertainingly I'm anthropomorphizing the ANS by nicknaming it <i>ans</i> (rhymes with the German name Hans).

<p>Yesterday I was affected by your text about going slow. I thought you weren't happy with what's happened.  Then I remembered reading about ans!  I reviewed what you wrote, with the strongest effort to remain rational and "find out what really happened".  I found nothing wrong with what you wrote, because there wasn't anything wrong with it!  Not only that, but you were engaging in the kind of communication we both want!

<p>I was like, wtf, then why am I feeling all of these negative things?!  Oh!  ans!  I left early for the concert.  I outlouded for about a half an hour before arriving at the church.  I realized that ans went right to the negative.  It thought that you were having negative thoughts about our first planned night together.  From the moment you arrived until the moment you left was so very lovely and special for me, and ans thought that after the fact, you didn't like it.  Melike, I was intent on getting to the bottom of it.  (I'll continue to make the best efforts, and predict successful outcomes.)  I thought about what you said and could not find a rational reason for being upset.  But... ans!  I'm working better understand ans' tendency to jump right to bad outcomes, with a view toward having quicker and more healthy responses.  And to minimize its effect on my behavior and what I say.

<p>From the start I fervently wanted not to say anything I'd regret.  That was a priority!  If I hadn't yet read about ans, I think I might have.  I don't want that, omg!  I would've created a problem that didn't exist.  I don't want that!  And when I reread your text indicating the importance to you of proactively letting me know how you're feeling, and when I stopped to take in how impactful our recent status change could be in your life, I wanted to let you know I heard what you said, and that I appreciated it.  Text messages go by so quickly!

<p>
When I didn't understand what was happening, and when I thought something critical had been said, I suggested a phone conversation if not in-person would be better.  Although it does seem useful to point out there are some significant limitations to text conversations, please don't take that as a "rule".  I don't want to inhibit your communication, even in texts!  I always have the option of suggesting a call or meeting.

<p>I was still scared when I arrived at the church.  I didn't know what to expect.  I knew I couldn't hide from you. [!] I knew you'd done nothing wrong, and to the contrary, had been open and honest with me.  But my negative response was still strong.  wtf?  What's was going on here?  I was nervous when I saw you and Dane in my peripheral vision.  When you came over and hugged me (which was a nice surprise) and Dane asked if I'd like to sit with you (for which I'm grateful), I no longer wanted to be invisible.  But for most of the concert ans kept dwelling on thoughts that you didn't want to go forward with us.  Of course, you'd said nothing to indicate this, but... ans!  I was still feeling a mess of emotions.  During the concert I was grieving the loss of the relationship.  I was decrying the unfairness of it all.  Only a few days ago we connected in such a beautiful way, and now I couldn't even hold your hand!  (Quite dramatic, huh?)  At times the concert music was a melancholy soundtrack when I closed my eyes and envisioned moments we'd shared.  I almost cried.  The emotional aspect of many of the concert pieces only intensified my emotions.  At one point I had become unhappy and confused to the point that I considered getting up and leaving.  Before I read about ans, I might have, because surely reality was reflected in my negative emotions!  But my rational thought was, just stay.  It's OK.  Don't do or say anything you'll regret.  At one point I considered that it was akin to temporary insanity--the facts on the ground and my emotions conflicted.  I was physically safe, nothing was threatening me, and yet I could not dig myself out of it.  I'm glad the rational part of me prevailed.  I didn't do or say anything I regret.  When you leaned over and our shoulders touched the sun came out.  Maybe things weren't over!  Maybe it would be OK.  And I felt very, very silly.

<p>I'd previously told Jennifer and Lauren (the alto in the Advent choir), both of whom I love and have sung with for decades, and for both of whom I hold the highest regard) about you.  One of the first things I said to Jennifer was "The answer to your question is 'Yes'" as I nodded in your direction.  The implicit question was "Is that her?"  I told her that I was confused and hurting and was a mess.  She hugged me and said the kindest things to me and about me, and I was so moved I became a mess in a good way.  Her words about me were so kind and positive it was like she was talking about someone else.  I sent a heartfelt thank you email to her today.


<p>I find myself grateful to have read what I include here again:

<blockquote>
<i>
My brain wasn't making a conscious choice to feel or act this way; it was simply responding to signals that my nervous system perceived as a threat. Even more challenging, these responses happen at lightning speed while the rest of our brain operates at a much slower pace--and once the alarm in our body senses this painful disconnection, our conscious thoughts can't stop it.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
It helped me to realize I didn't do anything wrong and I didn't need to feel ashamed. My reaction was caused by a physiological system that was trained in my earliest years in non-helpful ways to cope with deficits in emotional care. An example:

<blockquote>
<i>
When we are young, we soon learn which of our behaviors lead to our parents' [emotional] disappearances and begin to suppress those parts. With no thought involved at all, we can begin to stop ourselves from healthy expressions of joy or sadness or anger in the effort to keep our parents with us.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
My automatic reaction was not something I consciously caused (although it is something I can and did try to understand and mitigate). It's not the kind of reaction I want. And as the author wrote, it happened an order of magnitude faster than conscious thought. The author also explains why even after my rational assessment I couldn't for a time stop the negative reaction.  But I give myself credit for identifying quickly what happened; recognizing the importance of not acting in a way I might regret on something I didn't yet understand and may not be true; powering through it; acting on helpful information I'd learned recently; and coming out the other side more equipped than before to identify and challenge such reactions.  Good job, me!

i told you yesterday i couldn't be as emotionally available to you going forward.  i was in a stormy sea of emotions and was being overly protective of myself.  i conjured up a painful future, and in the process created a painful present.  i also said it was unlikely that what we discovered about each other would lead to a different relationship.  another pointless conjuring of a painful future.  i <i>don't know</i> what will happen. i didn't think i could live with not knowing.  but i can.

<p>
i wasn't thinking of the strength and quality of our <i>current</i> relationship. the openness and the touch we shared saturday, and will continue to share, blows me away.  i pressed you for a hard "no" saturday, perhaps because i thought i couldn't accept a "no for now".  but i can.

<p>i wish i could've imagined another way out of the pain i was feeling, and i wish i hadn't said those things.  melike, i sincerely apologize for the pain i caused you.

I regret nothing. Last night we made a joyful discovery, but regardless of our feelings, it is unlikely to lead to a relationship. Last night, we willfully defied reality, drowned in the comfort of sweet words and of touch, and it was a night bittersweet. The highs were unimaginably high for me. Now going forward I'll deal with the lows. I know you're hurting, too.

<p>
I don't blame you. And I would never cause any problems for you in the social circles we have in common. In public, I will try to act as if nothing has happened.

<p>
I don't know today what it will take for me to navigate a broken heart. For how long I don't know, I can't be as emotionally available to you as I've been. I'll be figuring out how to navigate this. I have no ill feelings toward you.

<p>
Today I'm reeling and don't know what to do. But I have faith in my ability to figure out some of it. I don't know if I'll be able to say this again, and it's important to me to have said this to you, I realized last night that over the time we've spent together, I fell in love with you.

<p>
I like it when people are happy and nothing has happened that would keep that from applying to you. See you around publicly.

i imposed a solution on you for a problem that maybe didn't even exist.  i ghosted you temporarily.

<p>
what i did:
<br>* unilaterally decided to help, and then unilaterally determined <i>how</i> to help you with your screen time, at least today with me and messaging.  metaphorically temporarily ghosted you.

<p>
what i don't like about it:
<br>* i didn't ask you if you wanted help
<br>* if i had, and you wanted help, i didn't ask you what might be the most helpful
<br>* feels crappy to me, and maybe obnoxious

<p>
what i'd like to have done instead
<br>* said to you that given what i know about your screen time concerns, i might be taking too much of your time away from what you might want to do, and so may not be helping
<br>* asked you if i could help by going away for a while
<br>* accepting your response and acting on it

<p>
what i'll do in the future
<br>* not this!

<p>
it may sound like i'm beating myself up, but i'm not.  this is an external representation of how i work it out when i notice i've done something i'd like to do differently.

I gave you an unsatisfactory answer last night about Marilyn and Sybille.  I'd like another go at it...

<p>
Marilyn ran a soup kitchen in a church not too far from Advent.  When that kitchen was temporarily unavailable, she used the kitchen at Advent.  So I'd seen her around Advent.  Soon after that some Opera Plaza residents and I threw a party.  Marilyn was there and enjoyed speaking with her.  A couple months later as I was walking home from work downtown, I passed her on her way to the Tonga Room, a tiki bar (complete with live rain!).  She said she was meeting friends and would I like to join them.  I had drinks with her and her son Chris (the one who passed away two years ago), Sybille (who was currently boarding with Marilyn, and whose English I thought was already quite advanced), and two of Marilyn's former "students", visiting from Switzerland.  Marilyn had an arrangement with an English as a second language school in downtown SF.  They paid her to board students for months at a time.  After drinks we all went to a restaurant in North Beach.  I hadn't really noticed Sybille at the Tonga Room, but at the restaurant we were seated next to each other and had a blast.  Sybille and I talked a little about exercise and soon Marilyn, Sybille and I were meeting after work each week and walking in different San Francisco locales.

<p>
[...stuff happens, time passes...]

<p>
In December 2015 Sybille broke up with Simi (her other boyfriend--who lived in her town in Switzerland).  Needless to say, I was happy she got rid of the other guy.  I'd considered moving to Switzerland, but wanted to experience being in an exclusive relationship for at least a year before taking such a step (my therapist's very good suggestion).  Then in January 2016 she broke up with me.

<p>
Marilyn rooted for me throughout the entire bi-continental relationship.  She would say humorously "I hope Sybille doesn't fuck this up!"  She totally supported me.  She was tolerant with me because I wanted most of the time to talk about Sybille!

<p>
I no longer think Birdj is an asshole.  I've reframed a lot of my thinking about such things.  Ha ha I don't know how Marilyn currently thinks of him.  I'm sure she's still angry at some level.  He'd treated her quite badly when they were married.
