I'm happy to hear you enjoy this blog.  I enjoy writing it.  You mentioned you'd enjoy finding blog posts when you wake up.  We can do something about that.  At present, I haven't decided whether to send you notification of blog posts or not--having you discover them at some point.

I'd mentioned this letter to you that I wrote to my Dad six months before his death from lung cancer.  I think I mentioned he was pretty tough to deal with 90% of the time, but I guess his diagnosis moved me.

<p>
I mention some things in the letter that I did then, or that were true then.  Some of these things may not still be true.

<p>
<i>
May 1st and 2nd, 2012

<p>
Dear Dad,

<p>
I write to you from a moving train, on its way from San Francisco to Chicago, currently winding through the mountains, tracks intertwined with the Colorado River.  From time to time, I think about the fun you told me you had when you experienced the Colorado River from a raft.  I'm thinking about that today.  What a beautiful country we have.

<p>
I can't begin to understand what it must be like to be a hospice patient--or more specifically--to have 'qualified' to be one.  Nobody wins.  My heart goes out to you and I wish your cancer diagnosis wasn't real.

<p>
Shortly after I heard of your diagnosis, I started thinking about the effect you've had on my life.  Being computer-oriented, I took notes on my iPhone whenever I thought of an attribute I got from you, or some lesson I learned from you, or simply something I've enjoyed or do currently enjoy because you've been my dad.  What follows is my effort to let you know the effect you've had on me.

<p>

<p>
I think the thing I prize most from you is my intelligence.  There's no point in this letter in being falsely modest.  I'm damned smart and I got it from you.  I wonder from time to time what it must be like to be one of the 'beautiful people'.  Generally when folks use that term, they mean physical beauty or great wealth.  Although I have no problem with the way I look, I don't turn heads when I walk down the street.  And while I'm financially comfortable, I'm not a person of substantial wealth.  But I did win the IQ lottery.  I have an incredibly useful tool to help get me through life.  Not simply to survive it, but to really live it.  I seek not to be better or worse than others, but to be content at the end of the day.  Toward that goal I focus all of my intelligence.

<p>

<p>
I'm lucky that I'm also independent. I'm more than able to get along with people.  And they leave an encounter with me feeling positive.  But I follow the this personal rule:  anyone can give me data--information or opinion--but I and I alone am allowed to make my conclusions.  A friend once said to me, 'Nod your head and smile.  Then go and do what you were going to do anyway.'  It doesn't matter who gives the data.  It matters in the end whether I decide to embrace or reject it.  And no one has a say in the final decision but me.  I can't think of anyone in my life who's been a more prominent example of being independent than my dad.

<p>

<p>
Now for a lesson learned.  I'd be surprised if you remember this, but one day I was playing and either entered or exited the back yard.  To do so, I had to open the gate at the end of the driveway.  After I passed through, I left the gate open.  You were nearby and called me back.  You had me close the gate.  I don't remember your exact words but you said something like:  when you pass through a place, don't leave things worse than before you arrived.  Over the years I truly have taken this to heart.  I push my chair in when I leave the table at the restaurant, which is one small example.  I'm always disheartened by the small number of people who do this.  Apparently their father didn't teach them this lesson.  I am generally aware of the state of a place (or of things in general) and work hard not to degrade things as a function of my having been present.

<p>

<p>
Rare is the day in my life when I don't put something physically in my path in order to remind myself of something.  I don't remember specific instances, but I know it was you who taught me this.  I bet you still do this.

<p>

<p>
One of the things that enriches my life the most is music.  Music is in my soul.  I don't think it would be possible for me to have even a single day in my life when I didn't listen to or make music.  My love of rock music and renaissance polyphony (a type of choral music) sustains me.  And augments me.  And embellishes me.  (How many musical puns can you find in this paragraph?)  It started with singing (something I will do forever), and continued with trumpet, banjo, guitar, and piano.  I remember you playing the banjo and taking me to Shakey's.  I remember you humming much of the time.  I wish I had known you when you sang barbershop.  I just know I came to my love of music through you.

<p>
Ever since I moved to San Francisco, I have a regular haunt.  Max's Opera House Cafe, located in my block of the city, features a live pianist every night.  The man who plays most is named Larry.  One night years ago I put a couple dollars in the tip jar and requested 'The World's Waiting for The Sunrise.'  Now whenever Larry sees me, he plays it.

<p>

<p>
And now for some scary memories.  Literally scary.  As in Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, the Mummy, the Creature from The Black Lagoon… and friends.  I smile when I think about the times you and Rob and I spent watching 'monster movies' and, if I remember the host's name correctly, Count Gore Di Val.  (Was that on channel 20?  WDCA, Washington, D.C.?)  Monster movie time is a greatest hit of my childhood memories.  Over the years it led to a rich appreciation for science fiction and fantasy, which is my favorite book and movie genre.

<p>

<p>
And now for some good advice.

<p>
Stay in school; study computers

<p>
Stay in California

<p>
Remember when I arrived home from Blacksburg, Virgina for Christmas vacation in 1983 having withdrawn from Virginia Tech?  I announced that I was going to study guitar full time and then I was going to make a living as a musician.  Your and Mom's response was that I could study anything I wanted, but if I wasn't enrolled in some college, in a bachelor's degree program, I'd need to find my own place to live.  I remember thinking, 'Fine!  No problem.  I'll just get my own place.'  Well of course I had no idea how much it cost to rent an apartment.  I looked at several rental listings and it dawned on me how much it cost to live out from under a parent's wings.  The decision to attend Towson State wasn't difficult in light of that.  I started to study music full time, but you helped me realize that as a musician, I'd be scraping by, whereas if I had a computer related degree, I'd be comfortable enough to pursue music as an avocation.  Which I did.  With no regrets!  I remember a music professor saying that most people who make their living through music are not able to do so with the music they prefer, or even enjoy.  Weddings and bar mitzvahs!

<p>
And I'm sure you do remember when in 2003--which was the middle of what I now call my 'unscheduled sabbatical', I couldn't find work for nineteen months--I was at the end of my rope.  I saw no way to get a job.  I think it was the only time in my life I felt despair.  The only panic attack I've ever had was during this time.  I saw no way out.  I remember speaking with you on the phone.  I don't cry a lot.  I don't try to avoid it.  I'm just usually not that sad.  During this conversation, though, I was overwhelmed, and broke down and cried.  I told you I wanted to move back to Baltimore.  I reasoned that if I was going to be looking for a job for quite some time, I wanted to do it in an area less expensive to live.  You talked me out of it.  You told me that I would always regret giving up, and that I should stay in California.  You told me to get out of the house and meet people.  Indeed, because of this, 2003 turned out to be one of the best years ever for my social calendar.  While I didn't get a job until February 2004, I was able to get back on my feet emotionally.  You helped me make one of the most important decisions of my adult life.  I will never forget your help.

<p>

<p>
You met my cat Spot once when you visited my Ellicott City apartment.  As I recall, he was under the weather with a kitty cold and wasn't very social at the time.  I remember this disappointing me, as Spot was usually very friendly and not one to hide.  Spot lived with me eleven years until 2007.

<p>
You haven't met Maddy (short for Madeleine).  I often accuse her of being such a good cat that, theoretically, her existence isn't possible.  She just purrs.  I got her six months after I lost Spot.  Dad, I got my love of pets from you.  I almost remember King, who I believe was a German Shepherd we owned.  I remember Robin and Blackie.  I remember we had a few cats as well.  And now I can't imagine being without a four footed companion.

<p>
---

<p>
One of the interesting things about living in Ellicott City was that on my way to the Safeway on Route 40, I would pass what I amusingly thought of as the 'ruins' of The Enchanted Forest.  What great memories I have of you taking Rob and I there.  The birthday parties we had there.  I wish I had been able to enter 'the ruins' when I lived in Ellicott City, but I wasn't keen on violating the No Trespassing signs.

<p>

<p>
Several years ago I sent you prints of the pictures I took when we went to Lake Guerrero, Mexico.  I hope you enjoyed them.  That was, I believe, the first time I'd ever traveled outside the U.S.  I can't remember the name of the short trollish fellow, but I recall our guide's name was Silverio.  Even without looking at the pictures, I can remember the faces of those two.  One thing that made a great impression on me was being in a tiny boat with an outboard motor, navigating on a lake that had the top halves of dead trees sticking out of the water.  I believe a dam had been torn down years before to flood the valley and create the lake.  I also remember being a pretty bad shot.  You would shoot three shots and down three ducks (crows?).  I would fire half a dozen times and more often than not, waste the ammo.  But it was fun.

<p>
I also remember the roadside 'checkpoint'.  I don't know whether it was Mexican federales, local police, or a random group of armed men.  I remember being frightened, and then relieved when we went on our way unharmed.

<p>
I also remember that my first experience at pheasant hunting was incredibly boring.

<p>
---

<p>
I have a confession to make.  Although I haven't bought any in years, I'm a secret fan of 'squeeze cheese'.  The kind of 'processed cheese food product' that comes in a sealed, pressurized can, that you squirt out onto crackers by bending nozzle sticking out of the top of the can.

<p>
But whether 'cheezy' or real cheese, I picked up an appreciation of cheese and crackers from you.  Did I also get my love of spreadable port wine cheese from you?

<p>
---

<p>
I think I was never prouder of you than when I was in first grade, and you came to speak to my class.  The school had asked parents of students to discuss what they did for a living.  I was tickled pink when you spoke to my class about fictitious 'Sally' who had a toothache.  You were a true showman that day and I think everyone had as much fun listening as me.  At the time, one of the things dentists did to teach people about the areas they miss when they brush was to give out little red chewable tablets.  The idea was to chew them to make your teeth red and then brush.  Any remaining red areas after brushing were areas that were missed.

<p>

<p>
On to some practical lessons.  Kids are, obviously, born without knowledge, and must acquire it along the way... or not.  Two incredibly valuable practical lessons I learned from you.  1.  Don't try to get objective information on something from someone who's trying to sell it to you.  2.  If it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.

<p>
I approach sales people of all kinds with a robust skepticism, bordering on contempt, although with a poker face.

<p>
---

<p>
I can't remember exactly when, but when I was a fledgling adult, you gave me some handkerchiefs and suggested that carrying one all the time is useful.  To this day, I carry a handkerchief.  And it has been useful.

<p>
---

<p>
There's something else, the carrying of which you caused, that has always served me well.  Also at some point during my young adulthood, you handed me a hundred dollar bill and said to keep it in my wallet at all times.  You never know when you'll need it.  To this day, I do so, although I now carry $ 200 instead of $ 100.  If I run out of cash, I do borrow from it occasionally, but I always 'pay back' what I borrowed as soon as I get home.

<p>
---

<p>
How many everyday objects do we take for granted?  We use them when we need to, but when they're 'retired' we replace them and think little of it.  Makes sense.  If we remembered every object we've ever found useful, our brains would quickly become cluttered.  So if you don't remember this particular object, I won't be surprised.  It is the lamp from your waiting room at 7555 Ritchie Highway.  It's a ceramic lamp made in the 1960's.  I don't know why, but I remember it very clearly being in your waiting room.  It's in use at present in my living room.  I really, really like both the lamp itself, and also preserving a piece of my past.  I recently had it fixed, so it will now continue providing light and memories for a few more couple decades I hope.

<p>

<p>
I think my favorite family moment involving you is a little less than six months ago, when you, Mike, Rob, Julie, and I had crabs at the Crackpot restaurant.  I can't think of any other time I enjoyed one of our family gatherings more.  The crabs were, of course, excellent.  And the way we lingered for at least an hour, chatting, joking, and enjoying each others' company was truly memorable.

<p>
You may also find entertaining the fact that the date of the event is a palindrome - 11-20-2011.

<p>
---

<p>
I also remember 'scouting' for birds with you in the car.  Driving around portions of Maryland and, I think, Pennsylvania while you watched for patterns in avian activity.  I must say, though, Dad, I found your habit of flinging food particles onto the steering wheel of your car with dental floss quite gross!

<p>
---

<p>
Another thing I got from you is my love of eating out.  Now that I'm paying attention to my health, I eat out less frequently, but I enjoy it no less.  I can't help thinking it came from our practice of eating at Mr. Steak in Timonium when Rob and I were young.  I have fond memories of Mr. Steak.  If I recall correctly I had a fondness for their chocolate pudding.  I seem to remember yellow-ish water glasses.  I remember you chatting up the waitresses.

<p>
---

<p>
Yes, folks, I was a dental assistant at one point in my life!  I found it an easier way to make money than painting your house!  I remember Anna helping me.  I can't remember the other lady's name who also worked for you, but she was helpful, too.  At lunch time I would take my 1965 Ford Mustang south on Ritchie Highway and get a cold cut sub at a place whose name I can't recall.  I loved those cold cut subs.  Even today, I make a pilgrimage to Maria's on York Road in Timonium (not to far from Nautilus) to get a cold cut sub when I'm in the neighborhood.  They have something resembling these subs here on the west coast, but they don't understand the Baltimore use of the word 'hots'.  With respect to subs, Baltimoreans use 'hots' to mean a vinegar based cherry pepper relish.  I think it's more sweet than it is hot.  Without 'hots' a cold cut just isn't a cold cut.

<p>
Also, I'll always be entertained by the memory of the length of the entrance hallway at 7555 Ritchie Highway.  It was almost 'Get Smart'-ish.  (Remember Maxwell Smart?)

<p>
---

<p>
Speaking of Nautilus, I also get my love of diners from you.  I remember the Bel Loc diner.  I may have told you that since November of 2008, when I began exercising and losing weight, I have eaten breakfast (nearly) every Saturday morning at Mel's Diner about five blocks from where I live.  Two eggs over medium, two orders of bacon, hash browns, a bagel with extra cream cheese, and coffee.  Don't worry, Dad, it's only once a week.  And I lost seventy pounds despite doing that.  It was my once-a-week free-for-all meal.  A reward for being good the rest of the week.

<p>
---

<p>
I think my fondest memory of my childhood with you is that when I was very young, I remember you coming to say goodnight to me and running your fingers rough my hair.  A kid doesn't know it at the time, but later when he becomes an adult, he figures out how important that sort of thing is.

<p>
Thanks Dad.

<h3>Dane</h3>

<p>I'm grateful for Dane welcoming me into his visit with you.  When his visit started, I thought I had to disappear.  And that I had no place in your and his visit.  I didn't feel threatened.  I felt like I had no status and couldn't ask for anything.  So I didn't.  I just shared my feelings about it with you (I'm glad I did).  And by the way, I didn't get any of my insecurity from anything you did or said.  You didn't feed my feelings of tenuous status.  I got them all on my own!

<p>At the Clerestory concert, Dane asked if I'd like to come and sit with you guys.  What a wonderful, spontaneous kindness.  I never thought Dane would be anything other than nice and gracious.  I suspect he's a thoughtful and kind guy.  I like thoughtful and kind guys!  And then at motets, it seemed like he made sure to connect with me.  I had wanted to do that with him during his visit.  It felt good.  And last night was positively fun and interesting, and any traces of not being comfortable around him were finally eliminated.

<p>
Good job, all of us!

<h3>Girlfriends</h3>

<p>
I'm learning not to give so much weight to labels.  "Girlfriend/boyfriend" is a label.  Labels aren't reality.  Reality is reality.  When I asked that question yesterday, my insecurity leaked out.  I hadn't planned to ask that question.  And then I thought, "Why did I do that?  It wasn't necessary."  It devalued the reality of where we are.  And I very much value where we are.

<p>
You used the word "lovers" in a recent conversation.  That's our reality; it's not a label.  And my goodness, that's more than enough for me.  It's quite literally my short term ideal.  I like what "us" has become and where it seems to be going.  I have no issues with our pace.  It'll be what it'll be, and all the while, we are we.  And that's what I want the most--what's happening <i>now</i>.

<p>
I'm still plagued from time to time by niggling thoughts that it isn't as wonderful as it is, or it will stop soon.  [*David eyes <i>ans'</i> nut sack.  <i>ans</i> notices and backs away slightly.*]  Perhaps that's what's behind me asking my question yesterday.  When I look at the "evidence" I find nothing indicating my doubts are rational.  I find the contrary.  There was so much in our text conversations yesterday alone that causes me to feel silly to have asked if I'm your boyfriend.  How can I doubt my importance to you?  How can a label possibly compare to the current reality on the ground?  It can't.  It doesn't.  And it doesn't need to.  I'm thrilled about you, where we are, and our current pace.  And like Jason's comment, I'm looking forward to see what develops.  I give it a ten out of ten so far.

<p>TL;DR -- I'm soooooo happy I'm reading the attachment book.  It's already helpful in understanding why I sometimes have reactions that are harmful to me.  It's ironic that in trying to protect myself, the source of those reactions can hurt me unless I consciously intervene.  It helps me not to feel shame about a type of reaction that's difficult to control.  The good news is that I have agency in responding. That's what I'm all about now--learning how successfully to intervene.  (In case you're interested, I'm putting my notes on the attachment book <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XbgASvMwCNr9ZmBRvpzWskq8L2aX8IGrAy6k40eyuJA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.)

<p>My greatest revelation so far reading that book is reflected in this quote from the book.  The author is referring to herself.

<blockquote>
<i>
My brain wasn't making a conscious choice to feel or act this way; it was simply responding to signals that my nervous system perceived as a threat. Even more challenging, these responses happen at lightning speed while the rest of our brain operates at a much slower pace--and once the alarm in our body senses this painful disconnection, our conscious thoughts can't stop it.  However, it is possible to rewire our ability to regulate--the missing link in our developmental process as infants who did not receive consistent caregiving. Thanks to something called neuroplasticity, our brains can develop new circuitry at any age. The process of becoming self-full involves having the experiences of care and soothing we needed as children now.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm really looking forward to learning about the role my autonomous nervous system (ANS) plays in this.  Entertainingly I'm anthropomorphizing the ANS by nicknaming it <i>ans</i> (rhymes with the German name Hans).

<p>Yesterday I was affected by your text about going slow. I thought you weren't happy with what's happened.  Then I remembered reading about ans!  I reviewed what you wrote, with the strongest effort to remain rational and "find out what really happened".  I found nothing wrong with what you wrote, because there wasn't anything wrong with it!  Not only that, but you were engaging in the kind of communication we both want!

<p>I was like, wtf, then why am I feeling all of these negative things?!  Oh!  ans!  I left early for the concert.  I outlouded for about a half an hour before arriving at the church.  I realized that ans went right to the negative.  It thought that you were having negative thoughts about our first planned night together.  From the moment you arrived until the moment you left was so very lovely and special for me, and ans thought that after the fact, you didn't like it.  Melike, I was intent on getting to the bottom of it.  (I'll continue to make the best efforts, and predict successful outcomes.)  I thought about what you said and could not find a rational reason for being upset.  But... ans!  I'm working better understand ans' tendency to jump right to bad outcomes, with a view toward having quicker and more healthy responses.  And to minimize its effect on my behavior and what I say.

<p>From the start I fervently wanted not to say anything I'd regret.  That was a priority!  If I hadn't yet read about ans, I think I might have.  I don't want that, omg!  I would've created a problem that didn't exist.  I don't want that!  And when I reread your text indicating the importance to you of proactively letting me know how you're feeling, and when I stopped to take in how impactful our recent status change could be in your life, I wanted to let you know I heard what you said, and that I appreciated it.  Text messages go by so quickly!

<p>
When I didn't understand what was happening, and when I thought something critical had been said, I suggested a phone conversation if not in-person would be better.  Although it does seem useful to point out there are some significant limitations to text conversations, please don't take that as a "rule".  I don't want to inhibit your communication, even in texts!  I always have the option of suggesting a call or meeting.

<p>I was still scared when I arrived at the church.  I didn't know what to expect.  I knew I couldn't hide from you. [!] I knew you'd done nothing wrong, and to the contrary, had been open and honest with me.  But my negative response was still strong.  wtf?  What's was going on here?  I was nervous when I saw you and Dane in my peripheral vision.  When you came over and hugged me (which was a nice surprise) and Dane asked if I'd like to sit with you (for which I'm grateful), I no longer wanted to be invisible.  But for most of the concert ans kept dwelling on thoughts that you didn't want to go forward with us.  Of course, you'd said nothing to indicate this, but... ans!  I was still feeling a mess of emotions.  During the concert I was grieving the loss of the relationship.  I was decrying the unfairness of it all.  Only a few days ago we connected in such a beautiful way, and now I couldn't even hold your hand!  (Quite dramatic, huh?)  At times the concert music was a melancholy soundtrack when I closed my eyes and envisioned moments we'd shared.  I almost cried.  The emotional aspect of many of the concert pieces only intensified my emotions.  At one point I had become unhappy and confused to the point that I considered getting up and leaving.  Before I read about ans, I might have, because surely reality was reflected in my negative emotions!  But my rational thought was, just stay.  It's OK.  Don't do or say anything you'll regret.  At one point I considered that it was akin to temporary insanity, the kind they talk about in love stories--the facts on the ground and my emotions conflicted.  I was physically safe, nothing was threatening me, and yet I could not dig myself out of it.  I'm glad the rational part of me prevailed.  I didn't do or say anything I regret.  When you leaned over and our shoulders touched the sun came out.  Maybe things weren't over!  Maybe it would be OK.  And I felt very, very silly.

<p>I'd previously told Jennifer and Lauren (the alto in the Advent choir), both of whom I have great affection for and have sung with for decades, and for both of whom I hold the highest regard) about you.  One of the first things I said to Jennifer was "The answer to your question is 'Yes'" as I nodded in your direction.  The implicit question was "Is that her?"  I told her that I was confused and hurting and was a mess.  She hugged me and said the kindest things to me and about me, and I was so moved I became a mess in a good way.  Her words about me were so kind and positive it was like she was talking about someone else.  I sent a heartfelt thank you email to her today.


<p>I find myself grateful to have read what I include here again:

<blockquote>
<i>
My brain wasn't making a conscious choice to feel or act this way; it was simply responding to signals that my nervous system perceived as a threat. Even more challenging, these responses happen at lightning speed while the rest of our brain operates at a much slower pace--and once the alarm in our body senses this painful disconnection, our conscious thoughts can't stop it.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
It helped me to realize I didn't do anything wrong and I didn't need to feel ashamed. My reaction was caused by a physiological system that was trained in my earliest years in non-helpful ways to cope with deficits in emotional care. An example:

<blockquote>
<i>
When we are young, we soon learn which of our behaviors lead to our parents' [emotional] disappearances and begin to suppress those parts. With no thought involved at all, we can begin to stop ourselves from healthy expressions of joy or sadness or anger in the effort to keep our parents with us.
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
My automatic reaction was not something I consciously caused (although it is something I can and did try to understand and mitigate). It's not the kind of reaction I want. And as the author wrote, it happened an order of magnitude faster than conscious thought. The author also explains why even after my rational assessment I couldn't for a time stop the negative reaction.  But I give myself credit for identifying quickly what happened; recognizing the importance of not acting in a way I might regret on something I didn't yet understand and may not be true; powering through it; acting on helpful information I'd learned recently; and coming out the other side more equipped than before to identify and challenge such reactions.  Good job, me!

i told you yesterday i couldn't be as emotionally available to you going forward.  i was in a stormy sea of emotions and was being overly protective of myself.  i conjured up a painful future, and in the process created a painful present.  i also said it was unlikely that what we discovered about each other would lead to a different relationship.  another pointless conjuring of a painful future.  i <i>don't know</i> what will happen. i didn't think i could live with not knowing.  but i can.

<p>
i wasn't thinking of the strength and quality of our <i>current</i> relationship. the openness and the touch we shared saturday, and will continue to share, blows me away.  i pressed you for a hard "no" saturday, perhaps because i thought i couldn't accept a "no for now".  but i can.

<p>i wish i could've imagined another way out of the pain i was feeling, and i wish i hadn't said those things.  melike, i sincerely apologize for the pain i caused you.

I regret nothing. Last night we made a joyful discovery, but regardless of our feelings, it is unlikely to lead to a relationship. Last night, we willfully defied reality, drowned in the comfort of sweet words and of touch, and it was a night bittersweet. The highs were unimaginably high for me. Now going forward I'll deal with the lows. I know you're hurting, too.

<p>
I don't blame you. And I would never cause any problems for you in the social circles we have in common. In public, I will try to act as if nothing has happened.

<p>
I don't know today what it will take for me to navigate a broken heart. For how long I don't know, I can't be as emotionally available to you as I've been. I'll be figuring out how to navigate this. I have no ill feelings toward you.

<p>
Today I'm reeling and don't know what to do. But I have faith in my ability to figure out some of it. I don't know if I'll be able to say this again, and it's important to me to have said this to you, I realized last night that over the time we've spent together, I fell in love with you.

<p>
I like it when people are happy and nothing has happened that would keep that from applying to you. See you around publicly.

i imposed a solution on you for a problem that maybe didn't even exist.  i ghosted you temporarily.

<p>
what i did:
<br>* unilaterally decided to help, and then unilaterally determined <i>how</i> to help you with your screen time, at least today with me and messaging.  metaphorically temporarily ghosted you.

<p>
what i don't like about it:
<br>* i didn't ask you if you wanted help
<br>* if i had, and you wanted help, i didn't ask you what might be the most helpful
<br>* feels crappy to me, and maybe obnoxious

<p>
what i'd like to have done instead
<br>* said to you that given what i know about your screen time concerns, i might be taking too much of your time away from what you might want to do, and so may not be helping
<br>* asked you if i could help by going away for a while
<br>* accepting your response and acting on it

<p>
what i'll do in the future
<br>* not this!

<p>
it may sound like i'm beating myself up, but i'm not.  this is an external representation of how i work it out when i notice i've done something i'd like to do differently.

I gave you an unsatisfactory answer last night about Marilyn and Sybille.  I'd like another go at it...

<p>
Marilyn ran a soup kitchen in a church not too far from Advent.  When that kitchen was temporarily unavailable, she used the kitchen at Advent.  So I'd seen her around Advent.  Soon after that some Opera Plaza residents and I threw a party.  Marilyn was there and enjoyed speaking with her.  A couple months later as I was walking home from work downtown, I passed her on her way to the Tonga Room, a tiki bar (complete with live rain!).  She said she was meeting friends and would I like to join them.  I had drinks with her and her son Chris (the one who passed away two years ago), Sybille (who was currently boarding with Marilyn, and whose English I thought was already quite advanced), and two of Marilyn's former "students", visiting from Switzerland.  Marilyn had an arrangement with an English as a second language school in downtown SF.  They paid her to board students for months at a time.  After drinks we all went to a restaurant in North Beach.  I hadn't really noticed Sybille at the Tonga Room, but at the restaurant we were seated next to each other and had a blast.  Sybille and I talked a little about exercise and soon Marilyn, Sybille and I were meeting after work each week and walking in different San Francisco locales.

<p>
[...stuff happens, time passes...]

<p>
In December 2015 Sybille broke up with Simi (her other boyfriend--who lived in her town in Switzerland).  Needless to say, I was happy she got rid of the other guy.  I'd considered moving to Switzerland, but wanted to experience being in an exclusive relationship for at least a year before taking such a step (my therapist's very good suggestion).  Then in January 2016 she broke up with me.

<p>
Marilyn rooted for me throughout the entire bi-continental relationship.  She would say humorously "I hope Sybille doesn't fuck this up!"  She totally supported me.  She was tolerant with me because I wanted most of the time to talk about Sybille!

<p>
I no longer think Birdj is an asshole.  I've reframed a lot of my thinking about such things.  Ha ha I don't know how Marilyn currently thinks of him.  I'm sure she's still angry at some level.  He'd treated her quite badly when they were married.
